Bitmonkey
=============


![Bitmonkey](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Musicious/Bitmonkey/master/src/resources/svg/bitmonkey-fangs-wide.png)
*Note: This does not work yet..

Bitmonkey aims to provide a gateway between the Metanet & the Internet by adapting the Greasemonkey model of userscripts support for browsers and integrating it with the Bitcom schema. Allowing for Bitcoin developers to easily add support for their Bitcoin projects into the current Internet without the need for an individual Browser extension to be installed for each application.

Bitmonkey will allow Metanetters to redesign the current internet in our image. From added functionality and interoperability too theming and modding of sites. The Bitmonkey model should allow for decentralized development and coordination in creating this vision.

### The Browser Extention

The underlying system will work on browsers with [WebExtensions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Add-ons/WebExtensions) support.

More details can be found [here](https://bitmonkey.xyz/).

Bitmonkey (will) only accepts scripts which are stored on the Bitcoin Blockchain utilizing the Bitcom schema. It allows developers to monitize their Userscript creations if they so choose.

At present it is too early to integrate an Identity system as there are many in development. A unified solution is not yet available.

A c:// file is a file which are addressed by their file hash.

The Bitmonkey Extension will text this hash before installing the Script.


This way a script file can be assessed by a professional team for security vunerabilities.

Bitmonkey Pro

A Pro version can be created for Enterprise Client Systems.


Bitmonkey Plumbing:

Web Interfaces for Systems are ubiquitous today. By cleverly utilising the Userscript schema we will be able to create integrations between existing systems and the Metanet/Bitcoin Systems.

Tentative Roadmap
---

Moneybutton & Unwriter:
-----
Bitmonkeys wallet and payments system will operate through the moneybutton system. We will hope to integrate support for Handcash's naming space and cashport. Userscripts will be able to access the moneybutton JS libraries through Bitmonkey and Unwriters stack.

UserScripts
-----
Userscripts will be uploaded into the Bitcoin blockchain within the Addon. When uploading a Userscript it will have associated metadata and a strict naming convention. Userscripts can be organised with these 'tags' so that users can easily browse through the collection of scripts which they may like to add. Language Tags are nessesary.

Some scripts can have dependencies on other Userscripts and will need to be loaded after them. Updates can be managed through this system too. Developers public keys will be used to authenticate developers.

Example Tags:

Twitter Tipper Buttons (Adds buttons for tipper within twitter) --> Dependency TippermainApp - General TipperApp functionality

Twitter Tipper Theme Script (A unique styling for the tipper button) --> Dependency Twitter Tipper Buttons


Profiles and Syncing:
-----
By natively storing the users profile on the blockchain (encrypted or not) users can sync there Bitmonkey setup natively across multiple browsers and computers. Users can share profile setups and even switch between different setups for different use cases. ie - A preferred Dev Environment as opposed to browsing setup/ Gaming setup.

Bitmonkey will come by default with the Bitmonkey default profile switched on. Hopefully we will have an unwriter, moneybutton profiles enabled by default too. This will mean that users setup will be automatically updated to use the latest additions to those profiles and can get the benefits of updates without updating the main extension.

Profiles can be created which combine 'suites' of UserScripts that could cover various use cases

Profiles can be monitized through the system.

Possible Ideas for Userscripts
-----
Tipper Bot integration into Social media Platforms.

Etched Buttons within Social Media platforms for speed of use. Could also be tied into a chatbot to let the user know their post has been etched...forever.


Review system for userscripts hosted on Bitcoin, also flagging of malicious code by trusted devs/users.


Development
---
Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) greater than v8.0 is installed.
``` sh
# Install dependencies
$ yarn

# Watch and compile
$ yarn dev
```
Then load the extension from 'dist/'.

Build
---
``` sh
$ yarn build
```
