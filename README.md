Bitmonkey provides Bitcoin hosted userscripts support for browsers.. Allowing for Bitcoin developers to easily add support for their Bitcoin projects. 


Bitmonkey only accepts scripts which are stored on the Bitcoin Blockchain utilizing the Bitcom schema.

Allows developers to monitize their Userscript creations
If the script is safe it will be so always because that transaction cannot be changed.
